#### A full-stack twitter clone built on:

* Mongo
* Express
* React
* Node
* Redux
* React-DOM
* Bootstrap

A twitter clone built initially as part of the Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp, extended and customised myself.

The site is built on a Node/Express API with a Mongo database, with React/Redux handling the front end.

It makes extensive use of Redux for API interactions and authentification, and Bootstrap for a base UI to build off.

Current features are user signup & signin and RESTful message routing, with full RESTful routing a main goal.
